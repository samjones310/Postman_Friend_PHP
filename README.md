Introduction:
The trend of this modern world is moving towards automation and smartness insolving real time hackneyed process. For instance parcel delivery to individuals is aredundant process that is carried out by the postal department. In this patent an ideais proposed to reduce the human power and expenses involved in the delivery system. The initial work involved in process is to set up a database which includes setting up a unique id for every building and to register the number of person’s living in that building along with their Aadhaar Id. While sending a parcel to a individual it is enough either to mention their aadhaar id or his/her residential unique id. The unique id for every building is prepared which contains the latitude and longitude co-ordinates of that building.These unique id’s can be used by google maps in updating the location in their database as google maps addressing system is not correct for every address.
Technical Field of Invention:
This invention is to make all the form of delivery systems (including postal and courier service) of our country easy by setting a unique id for every building in our country with an added advantage of linking the Aadhaar id with the unique id of the building. This idea can be helpful in updation of address in Aadhaar. This database can be used by banks, companies to sent the letter’s to an individual by using their aadhaar id as already all bank customers are linked with thier aadhaar it will be easy to implement.
Summary of Invention:
Every place in this earth has a unique latitude and longitude coordinates but address cannot be unique it may be repeated. Initially every individual has to create an account by providing the data like his/her name, aadhaar id of person living in that residence, residence latitude longitude by placing the mouse over the residence in the map .The creation of account will provide you a username and password which can be used later to update his/her location in change of home and also to remove a person from your home. The person can live in only one location if he/she is already in another location the he/she must be removed from the previous location by that user. A login is provided to the user where initially he/she can upto a maximum of 6 members initially and can use edit option to add or remove members in that location. The user can get linked to the unique id of theirhouse/building by entering their property id provided by property tax department. In case of apartments the unique id differs for every flat. Basically the letters and parcels for institution and industries are not based on the individual and based on the industry location unique ID.
The unique id can be produced with reference with various government database’s like property tax, registration of lands(department of land resources) and others. After set up of database then is no need of writing long address in the envelope orparcels it is just enough to write the aadhaar id for whom the letter/parcel has to be sent or the residence unique id where the parcel/letter has to be delivered. As we are using easily scanable 2-Dimensional Quick Response (QR) Code to represent the address. The QR Code we are using to stick in the envelope or parcel consists of latitude and longitude co-ordinates. The QR Code is generated by extracting the latitude and longitude coordinates from the database for the aadhaar id/unique location id included in the envelope. As we are providing unique location for a building it can be used by other departments of the government like water tax and electricity bill (EB), however EB
has more than one connection in most of the cases. The unique id can be assigned to every building based on data from the government
database’s like property tax, registration of lands. The notable achievement of this idea is to reduce the human effort involved in the segregation of letters/parcels by setting the range for area in terms of latitude and longitude. As the range is set for region and our QR Code is pasted on the envelope which consists of latitude and longitude range it automatically segregates the parcels based on region without any human intervention.This can be achieved by a process called reverse geocoding .
The main advantage of this idea is that the parcel segregation is carried out automatically without any manual work which reduces both the time and cost involved.The segregation of parcels is automated by backend integration of scanning the QR Code and deciding which state it is to be delivered.This set up is needed in Rail Mail Service(1 centre in every city) and in case of courier in regional office or hub.If a person has to deliver hundred letters in a day still now postman looks into the letter and plans manually to decide the order of delivery of letters which depends on the experience and knowledge about the area. The proposed idea of sticking QR Code introduces automation in this process by scanning the QR Codes the shortest route to deliver all the letters is identified.
